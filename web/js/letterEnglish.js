    <p>To the parents of second and third grade students.</p>
    <p>Dear Parents,</p>
    <p>This school year, the state of Bremen is once again taking part in the Europe-wide initiative to survey child growth (WHO-COSI). This activity is part of a health survey by the World Health Organization (WHO). The results are also used for the state health reporting of the state of Bremen. The study was initiated by the Senate Authority for Health, Women and Consumer Protection and the Authority for Science and Ports. The study is carried out by the Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology - BIPS.</p>
    <p>From October 2022 to February 2023, trained staff will measure the height, weight, hip and waist circumference of the children in the second and third grades. The approximately 5-minute body measurement takes place at your children's school in a separate room to their classroom. The children are measured in light clothing (e.g. light sportswear). Boys and girls are measured separately. Our staff is trained to treat your child in a sensitive and caring manner. </p>
    <p>In the enclosed questionnaire for parents, we ask questions about yourself and your child's health behavior. We assure you that we treat all information concerning you and your child as strictly confidential, and observe all legal data protection requirements. </p>
    <p>Please find more information below.</p>
    <p>By choosing to participate, you support our common goal of improving the health and well-being of our children across Europe. Participation in this survey is voluntary and you will not incur any disadvantages if you do not participate.</p>
    <p>Please fill out the declaration of consent and questionnaire within one week, and give both to your child to hand in at school. Your child cannot participate without this declaration of consent.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions about the study, you can reach the study team at BIPS on weekdays between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. on the telephone number: </p>
    <p><b>0421 218 56830</b> (in German) or by e-mail: <a href="who-cosi@leibniz-bips.de"><b>who-cosi@leibniz-bips.de</b></a>.</p>
    <p>Thank you very much for taking the time to participate.</p>
    <p>Kind regards,</p>
    <p>Wolfgang Ahrens</p>
    <p>(Principal investigator)</p>

        <h2>What is COSI and what is the aim of this survey…</h2>
        <li><p>COSI stands for the Childhood Obesity Surveillance Initiative. It is a World Health Organization (WHO) survey to routinely record the physical development of primary school children. Five survey rounds have already taken place in 46 countries since 2007.</p></li>
        <li><p>The aim of this initiative is to determine the frequency of overweight and obesity in children aged 7 to 9. The survey enables country comparisons to be made within Europe, and shows changes in childhood obesity over time. </p></li>
        <li><p>This data is the basis for the development of health promotion measures and the verification of their effectiveness in Europe.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h2>Who are the initiators in Germany…</h2>
        <li><p>The COSI survey is carried out jointly by the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Europe, the Senate Authority for Health, Women and Consumer Protection and the Authority for Science and Ports and the Bremen Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology - BIPS.</p></li>
        <li><p>The COSI survey was evaluated and approved by the Senate Authority for Education and Children.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h2>What data do we collect…</h2>
        <li><p>Body measurements of the children: height, weight, and circumference of hip and waist.</p></li>
        <li><p>Questionnaire for parents on nutrition, health and exercise, as well as nationality and family aspects.</p></li>
        <li><p>Questionnaire for head of the school on educational environment, e.g., frequency of physical education classes, availability of playgrounds, access to drinks at school.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h2>What is the process…</h2>
        <li><p>The class teacher will give your child an envelope with two consent forms, a questionnaire and a return envelope. </p></li>
        <li><p>Please fill out one consent form and the questionnaire, and place both in the return envelope. Give your child the sealed envelope to return to their school within one week. You should keep the other consent form for your information.</p></li>
        <li><p>At school, the documents will be stored unopened in a lockable cabinet until they are given to our screening team. </p></li>
        <li><p>The date of the examination day will be communicated to you in due time. Please make sure that your child brings light sportswear on that day. </p></li>
        <li><p>Your child's examination will take approximately 5 minutes. Height and weight measurements are certainly familiar to your child. Waist and hip circumference will be determined using a tape measure. The examination is performed on your child by trained personnel in a careful and sensitive manner. Boys and girls are examined separately.</p></li>
        <li><p>Your child will be asked if he or she would like to participate immediately before the exam.  Either you or your child may discontinue the survey at any time without giving a reason.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h2>What happens with the data…</h2>
        <li><p>All collected data and contact information are stored at the Bremen Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology - BIPS. The examination data are pseudonymized, meaning they are not stored and analyzed together with the children's names, but instead are only marked with an identification number. </p></li>
        <li><p>Names and addresses are locked securely and kept separately from the examination data. </p></li>
        <li><p>For some evaluations, pseudonymized examination data and results will be transmitted to the cooperation partners.<u></u></p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>World Health Organization (WHO Regional Office for Europe) and </p></li>
                <li><p>Bremen Senate Authority for Health, Women and Consumer Protection and the Authority for Science and Ports </p></li>
            </ul>
            <p><u>Pseudonymized</u> means that neither names nor contact data of the participating persons are passed on to the cooperation partners.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Your name or contact details will not be mentioned or published in any report. </p></li>
        <li><p>All legal data protection requirements applicable in Germany will be observed in the study. If you have any questions about data protection, you will find the responsible contact person on the last page of the printed study information.</p></li>   
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h2>Conditions of participation and possibility of revocation</h2>
        <li><p>Students of second and third grades, and their parents, in elementary schools across the state of Bremen can participate. </p></li>
        <li><p>You will receive two copies of the consent form for your child's participation. Your child can only participate if a signed consent form is present at school on the day of the examination. </p></li>
        <li><p>The second copy of the consent form will remain with your records. </p></li>
        <li><p>Your child participates in the COSI survey voluntarily. Either you or your child may discontinue the survey at any time without giving a reason.</p></li>
        <li><p>Completion of the parent questionnaire is voluntary, but recommended. However, your child can also participate in the COSI body measurements if you do not complete the parent questionnaire.</p></li>
